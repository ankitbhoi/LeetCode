here that i+1 % nums.size basically compares two elements side by side
as soon as our iterator reaches the last element it will get compared to the first element <br/>
now what we are doing here is <br/>
34512 only one irregularity will be there that is 5>1 <br/>
but at times two/more will be found which will prove the flaw in the array <br/>
for example 2134 , here 2>1 and 4>2 hence two irregularities. <br/>
